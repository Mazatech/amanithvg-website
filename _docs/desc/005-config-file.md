# Configuration parameters API

```c
VGErrorCode vgConfigSetMZT(VGConfigMzt config,
                           VGfloat value);
```

Configure parameters and thresholds for the AmanithVG library. This function can be called at any time, but it will have effect only if:
- the library has not been already initialized by a previous call to `vgInitializeMZT`, or
- the library has been already initialized (i.e. `vgInitializeMZT` has been already called) but no contexts have been already created

Certain `VGConfigMzt` values refer to read-only parameters. Calling `vgConfigSetMZT` on these parameters has no effect (`VG_NO_ERROR` is returned).

```c
VGfloat vgConfigGetMZT(VGConfigMzt config);
```

Get the current value relative to the specified configuration parameter. If the given parameter is invalid (i.e. it does not correspond to any value of the `VGConfigMzt` enum type), a negative number is returned.

Please note that both functions do not set the internal context error, so they have no influence on the value returned by `vgGetError`.
The `VGConfigMzt` enum type defines all the parameters that can be modified:

For legacy reasons, here's the documentation for AmanithVG versions before 5.0.3:

AmanithVG provides a configuration file to control and configure some internal settings and thresholds.<br>
The file must be named `amanithvg.conf` on *nix (including MacOS X) Target Platforms and `amanithvg.ini` on Windows (including Windows CE) based Target Platforms.<br>
The file must be placed in `/etc` directory on *nix (including MacOS X) Target Platforms and in the same directory containing AmanithVG dll on Windows based Target Platforms, except for Windows CE that needs the file to be located within the `\Windows` directory.<br>
AmanithVG will look for the following sections:

## [OpenGL] section

Parameters present in this section control OpenGL features used by AmanithVG GLE. In the detail:

 * `forceRectTexturesDisabled`: it forces AmanithVG GLE to avoid the use of `GL_EXT_texture_rectangle` or `GL_ARB_texture_rectangle extension`, even if it's supported by the GL Graphic System.<br>
 Valid values are `false` and `true`. The default value is `false`.

 * `forceMirroredRepeatDisabled`: it forces AmanithVG GLE to avoid the use of `GL_ARB_texture_mirrored_repeat` extension, even if it's supported by the GL Graphic System.<br>
 Valid values are `false` and `true`. The default value is `false`.

 * `forceClampToBorderDisabled`: it forces AmanithVG GLE to avoid the use of `GL_ARB_texture_border_clamp` extension, even if it's supported by the GL Graphic System.<br>
 Valid values are `false` and `true`. The default value is `false`.

 * `forceBlendMinMaxDisabled`: it forces AmanithVG GLE to avoid the use of `GL_EXT_blend_minmax extension`, even if supported by the GL Graphic System.<br>
 Valid values are `false` and `true`. The default value is `false`.

 * `forceDot3Disabled`: it forces AmanithVG GLE to avoid the use of `GL_EXT_texture_env_dot3` or `GL_ARB_texture_env_dot3` extension, even if supported by the GL Graphic System.<br>
 **WARNING**: setting this parameter as true will compromise the correct drawing of images in stencil image mode.<br>
 Valid values are `false` and `true`. The default value is `false`.

 * `forceVBODisabled`: it forces AmanithVG GLE to avoid the use of Vertex Buffer Objects (VBO), even if they are supported by the GL Graphic System.<br>
 Valid values are `false` and `true`. The default value is `false`.

 * `maxPermittedTextureUnits`: it forces the maximum number of texture units that AmanithVG GLE can use.<br>
 Valid values are `2, 3, 4` (AmanithVG GLE uses no more than 4 texture units; at least 2 texture units are always required). The default value is `4`.

 * `maxTextureSize`: it forces the maximum texture size that AmanithVG GLE can use.<br>
 Valid values are `0 (autodetect), 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192`. Other values will be ignored. The default value is `0`.

 * `forceBufferDisabled`: when both depth and stencil buffers are available on the GL context, it forces the specified buffer to be unused by AmanithVG GLE.<br>
 Valid values are `depth`, `stencil`, `none`. Other values will be ignored. The default value is `none`.

 * `supposePersistentBuffers`: suppose depth and stencil buffers to be persistent. Please note that, while on desktop platforms persistent buffers are common, the same is not so common on embedded (OpenGL ES) platforms.<br>
 **WARNING**: setting this parameter as true on GL Graphic System with non-persistent buffers, will compromise a correct rendering on some specific OpenVG features.<br>
 Valid values are `false` and `true`. The default value is `false`.

 * `forceScissorDisabled`: avoid the use of GL scissor feature, even if supported by the GL Graphic System.<br> **WARNING**: this parameter is provided to address compatibility issues; setting this parameter as `true` when the stencil buffer is not available to AmanithVG GLE, will compromise a correct rendering on some specific OpenVG features. Furthermore it will have a negative impact on performance.<br>
 Valid values are `false` and `true`. The default is `false`.

 * `forceColorMaskingDisabled`: avoid the use of GL color masking feature, even if supported by the GL Graphic System.<br> **WARNING**: this parameter is provided to address compatibility issues; setting this parameter as `true` will compromise a correct rendering on some specific OpenVG features.<br>
 Valid values are `false` and `true`. The default is `false`.

 Valid values are `false` and `true`. The default is `false`.

 * `forceDitheringOnImages`: it forces AmanithVG GLE to dither image textures, when the drawing surface is configured to have less than 8bit per color component (e.g. RGB565).<br>
 Valid values are `false` and `true`. The default is `false`.

 * `forceRGBATextures`: if true, it forces GL\_RGBA texture format even for opaque paint/images. If false use GL_RGB texture format for opaque paint/images.<br>
 Valid values are `false` and `true`. The default is `true`.

---

## [Geometry] section

Thresholds present in this section define the accuracy of AmanithVG geometry engine. In the detail:

 * `curvesQuality`: it affects the process that approximates curves with a set of straight line segments (flattening).<br>
 Valid range is `[0; 100]`, where `100` represents the best achievable quality. The default value is `90`.

 * `radialGradientsQuality`: it affects the quality of radial gradients paint.<br>
 Valid range is `[0; 100]`, where `100` represents the best achievable quality. The default value is `75`.

 * `conicalGradientsQuality`: it affects the quality of conical gradients paint, when `VG_MZT_conical_gradient` extension is available.<br>
 Valid range is `[0; 100]`, where `100` represents the best achievable quality. The default value is `75`.
