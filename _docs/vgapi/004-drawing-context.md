# Drawing Context

## API States [4]

OpenVG functions that perform drawing, or that modify or query drawing state make use of an implicit drawing context. A context is created, attached to a drawing surface, and bound to a running application thread outside the scope of the OpenVG API. OpenVG API calls are executed with respect to the context currently bound to the thread in which they are executed.
When an image, paint, path, font, or mask handle is defined, it is permanently attached to the context that is current at that time.
The context is responsible for maintaining the OpenVG API state, as shown in the table:

| State                                 | Description                                           |

## Forcing Drawing to Complete API [4.3]

```c
void vgFlush(void)
```

Ensure that all outstanding requests on the current context will complete in finite time.
This function may return prior to the actual completion of all requests.

{:.hrlight}

```c
void vgFinish(void)
```

Force all outstanding requests on the current context to complete, returning only when the last request has completed.
